Crystal structures for all elements of the periodic table,
collected from the Crystallography Open Database (COD) http://www.crystallography.net


This collection is:
* A set of sane, fairly reliable structures, meant to be  useful, 
  for example, as a starting point in an electronic structure 
  investigation.
* Selected from major standard works, such as Wyckoff's Crystal 
  Structures (1967) or from later sources when those appeared more
  reliable.
* Somewhat geared towards being useful for computational condensed
  matter physicists of the density functional theory persuation.
  Hence the preference for low temperature structures.
* At normal pressure.
* Standard conforming and generally well working CIF files.
* Gradually developing. Expect to see changes over time.

This collection isn't:
* Guaranteed to satisfy any specific needs or solve any 
  specific problems whatsoever for anyone.
* An authoritative reference data for electronic structure 
  benchmarking. There are probably more precise meaurements.
* Including weird stuff (apart from sulphur and some
  others of that ilk, which are intrinsically weird). 
  If you learned in high school that an element is a gas, 
  then you won't find its crystal structure here.
* Consistent in temperature range, you will find both low 
  temperature data and room temprature data here. But no
  high temperature stuff.
