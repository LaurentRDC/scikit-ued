def autocenter(im, mask=None, normalize_bg=True):
    """
    Find the center of a diffraction pattern automatically.

    .. versionadded:: 2.1.1

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray, shape (N, M)
        Diffraction pattern.
    mask : ndarray, shape (N,M), dtype bool, optional
        Mask that evaluates to `True` on pixels that
        should be used to determine the center.
    normalize_bg: bool, optional
        If `True` (default), an attempt will be made to remove
        asymmetries in the background of `im`. This can sometimes
        provide worse results, so you may want to disable this feature.

        .. versionadded:: 2.1.16


    Returns
    -------
    r, c : 2-tupe of ints
        Indices of the center, such that ``im[r, c]`` is the intensity value at
        the center of the pattern.

    Notes
    -----
    The procedure in this routine is an extension of the one in the reference below.
    It has been adapted for both single-crystal and polycrystalline diffraction patterns
    The continuous inversion symmetry is encoded as the coordinate transformation
    :math:`(r, \\theta) \\to (-r, \\theta)`. The shift between the image and inverted image
    determines the correction to the approximate center found by calculating the intensity
    center-of-mass.
