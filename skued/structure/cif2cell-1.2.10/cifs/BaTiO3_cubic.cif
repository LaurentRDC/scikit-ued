 The optimal structure CIF was identified and additional refinement
 parameters not present in the original as0598.cif file were added
 after consulting the text of the publication (R.H.Buttner &
 E.N.Maslen (1992) Acta Cryst. B pp. 764-769).

 The location of the FOBS data was specified in a footnote on the page
 765 of the original paper as follows:

 "Lists of structure factors and the correlation matrix for the
  non-centrosymmetric refinement of data set (1) have been deposited
  with the British Library Document Supply Centre as Supplementary
  Publication No. SUP 55254 (4 pp.). Copies may be obtained through
  The Technical Editor, International Union of Crystallography, 5
  Abbey Square, Chester CH1 2HU, England. [CIF reference: AS0598]"

 Unit cell constants for the cubic model (data blocks as0598e and
 as0598f) is taken from the R.H.Buttner & E.N.Maslen (1992) Acta
 Cryst. B p. 765:

 "The equivalent cubic cell dimension was set at 4.006 (2)\%A"

 The original CIF's _audit_creation_method value lists "as0598e is Model
 1-Set 1 & as0598f is Model1-Set 1"; thus, the same "Model 1-Set 1" is
 assigned to both datablocks as0598e and as0598f. The data in two data
 blocks as0598e and as0598f appear to be identical. There might be therefore
 a mistake in the provided model numbers, or a wrong data block might be
 inserted into the original as0598.cif file. But the blocks are for control
 anyway, so the solved structure not affected even if this was a mistake.

 In addition, atomic coordinates fiven for the cubic models (as0598e
 and as0598f) in the CIF file are different from thos provided in the
 table 2 of the publication. Again, the cubic models are only for
 illustration of a suboptimal structure, so this is not a big problem
 IMHO.

 Anisotropic temperature factors (Uij) and atomic charges determined
 by Hirshfeld (1977) methods are given as tables in the paper text. I
 did not have enough determination to key them in... ;)
