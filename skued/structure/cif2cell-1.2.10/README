CIF2CELL

A tool to generate the geometrical setup for various electronic 
structure codes from a CIF (Crystallographic Information 
Framework) file. The code will generate the crystal structure for 
the primitive cell or the conventional cell.

CONTENTS
The distribution includes:
* This README file.
* The file LICENSE with the GPLv3 license.
* The python files cif2cell, uctools.py and spacegroupdata.py
* Installation files, setup.py and MANIFEST.
* A manual.
* The directory cifs/ containing a set of example CIF files 
  as well as the crystal structures of the full periodic table 
  from COD, the Crystallography Open Database <http://www.crystallography.net>
  and also a few from ICSD (with permission).
* The file PyCifRW-3.3.tar.gz, containing the PyCifRW package needed for
  parsing CIF files.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Prerequisites: The program requires Python 2.4 or higher and the
               PyCIFRW python package (which will be installed 
               automatically if not present, see below for manual 
   	       installation instructions). Note however that the output
               may be slightly different (but formally equivalent) 
	       with Python 2.4 than with later versions.

To install the program in your systems standard location, simply type:
python setup.py install 
To choose a different location, add 
--prefix=where/you/want/it 
to the above line. For help and more options type
python setup.py --help

The installation will also create a directory $PREFIX/lib/cif2cell
that contains the manual and sample cif files.


DOCUMENTATION

The setup will install the manual, cif2cell.pdf, into the 
$PREFIX/lib/cif2cell/docs directory. 


RUNNING

Run 'cif2cell -h' to get a listing of the different options.
Example:
cif2cell Ni20Mn3P6.cif -p vasp --vasp-cartesian-positions
will generate a POSCAR file for VASP with the positions in cartesian format.
