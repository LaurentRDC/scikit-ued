    Measure the time shift between a time trace and a reference trace

    .. versionadded:: 1.0.1.1

    Parameters
    ----------
    trace : array-like, shape (N,)
        Time trace. Must be the same lengths as ``reference``. Only 1D traces are supported.
    reference : array-like
        Reference trace.
    method : str {'auto', 'fft', 'direct'}, optional
        A string indicating which method to use to calculate the correlation.

    Returns
    -------
    shift : int or float
        Index shift between the two traces, with respect to
        the ``reference`` trace. Note that the shift can be fractional.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError : if ``trace`` and ``reference`` do not have the same shape.
    ValueError : if ``trace`` is not a 1D array

def register_time_shifts(traces, reference=None, method="auto"):
    """
    Measure the time shifts between time traces and a reference by cross-correlation.

    .. versionadded:: 1.0.1.1

    Parameters
    ----------
    traces : iterable of ndarrays
        Time traces. These time-traces should be physically equivalent. Generators of time traces
        are also supported. All traces and ``reference`` must have the same shape.
    reference : `~numpy.ndarray` or None, optional
        If provided, the time-zero shift between the traces in ``traces`` will be measured
        with respect to ``reference``. Otherwise, the first trace in ``traces`` will be used
        as a reference.
    method : str {'auto', 'fft', 'direct'}, optional
        A string indicating which method to use to calculate the correlation.

    Returns
    -------
    shifts : `~numpy.ndarray`, ndim 1, dtype float
        Time shifts as indices (possibly fractional). The length of ``shifts`` is always
        equal to the number of time-traces; in the case where ``reference = None``, the first
        shifts will always be identically zero.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError : if not all traces have the same shape.
    ValueError : if traces are not 1D arrays
