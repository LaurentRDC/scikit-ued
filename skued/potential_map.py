def potential_map(q, I, crystal, mesh):
    """
    Compute the electrostatic potential from powder diffraction data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : ndarray, shape (N,)
        Scattering vector norm (:math:`Ã…^{-1}`).
    I : ndarray, shape (N,)
        Experimental diffracted intensity.
    crystal : crystals.Crystal
        Crystal that gave rise to diffraction pattern `I`.
    mesh : 3-tuple ndarrays, ndim 2 or ndim 3
        Real-space mesh over which to calculate the scattering map.
        Format should be similar to the output of numpy.meshgrid.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray, ndim 2 or ndim 3
        Electrostatic potential computed over the mesh.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError: if intensity data is not strictly positive.

    Notes
    -----
    To compute the scattering map from a difference of intensities, note that scattering
    maps are linear in *structure factor* norm. Thus, to get the map of difference data :code:`I1 - I2`:

    .. math::

        I = (\sqrt{I_1} - \sqrt{I_2})^2
