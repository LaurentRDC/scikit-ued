`scikit-ued`: (ultrafast) electron diffraction tools
****************************************************

Scikit-ued is an open-source Python package for data analysis and
modeling in (ultrafast) electron diffraction. The goal is to provide
tested, efficients algorithms and routines to students and researchers 
in electron diffraction and related fields.

The code presented herein has been in use at some point by the 
`Siwick research group <http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/siwicklab>`_.
