Collection of algorithms and functions for ultrafast electron diffraction. It aims to be a fully-tested package
taking advantage of Python's most recent features.

For examples, see our `tutorials <http://scikit-ued.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html>`_.

API Reference
-------------

The `API Reference on readthedocs.io <http://scikit-ued.readthedocs.io>`_ provides API-level documentation, as 
well as tutorials.

Installation
------------

scikit-ued is available on PyPI; it can be installed with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_.::

    python -m pip install scikit-ued

To install the latest development version from `Github <https://github.com/LaurentRDC/scikit-ued>`_::

    python -m pip install git+git://github.com/LaurentRDC/scikit-ued.git

Each version is tested against Python 3.5 and 3.6. If you are using a different version, tests can be run
using the standard library's `unittest` module.

After installing scikit-ued you can use it like any other Python module as ``skued``.

Optional dependencies
---------------------

While it is not strictly required, the fourier transform routines from ``pyfftw`` will be preferred If
``pyfftw`` is installed.
